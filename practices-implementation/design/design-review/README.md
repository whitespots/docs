# Design review

You can build this practice **not only as an independent** one but also as a part of the SDLC

{% page-ref page="../../../sdlc-secure-development-lifecycle.md" %}

## What will you get

* The list of the feature design risks and mitigation steps
* Additional feature security requirements
* As the product owner, you will get control of the security state before development

## What will change

* Business tasks will have security requirements in the description, so features will be developed secure literally by design

## What is the process

* Set a task
* Discuss risks with your security team
* Get risks and mitigations
* Decide what needs to be implemented

It can be helpful here, if your team has any questions:

{% page-ref page="../../security-champions.md" %}
